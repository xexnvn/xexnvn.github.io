### Key Paper

#### Titel
**Artificial intelligence-driven scalability and its impact on the sustainability and valuation of traditional firms** 

#### Authors
Roberto Moro-Visconti, Salvador Cruz Rambaud & Joaquín López Pascual

#### Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various industries has been a transformative force, impacting the operational dynamics and strategic decision-making of traditional firms, but there is not much-related research.

#### Problem
How artificial intelligence can improve the scalability of enterprise operations and affect the sustainable development and valuation of enterprises remains to be discussed.

#### Purpose
This study aims to partially fill this gap by addressing the scalability features of AI, enhanced by examining real-world cases and theoretical frameworks.

#### Base Theory
Enterprise artificial intelligence return on investment model.
  * Based on the input-output analysis theory, the model evaluates the impact of artificial intelligence technology on enterprise business and financial performance by comparing the financial value of artificial intelligence input and output. This model can provide a theoretical basis for analysing the economic benefits of artificial intelligence.

#### Data
Financial data
  * Collect sample enterprise annual report data for the past 5 years.
  * Including core financial indicators such as operating income, operating costs, gross profit, and operating profit.
  * Collect information such as the type of artificial intelligence technology and the investment the enterprise adopted during this period.

#### Method
Case analysis, empirical research on artificial intelligence returns on investment model.
  * Establish an artificial intelligence return on investment (AI-ROI) model.
  * AI-ROI = (Enterprise Benefit - Enterprise Benchmark Benefit) / AI Investment Cost
  * Enterprises benefitted from the new operating income/profit after using artificial intelligence.
  * The benchmark benefit is the income/profit before applying artificial intelligence.
  * The cost of AI investment is the actual cost of artificial intelligence technology research and development and application.

#### Results
The findings highlight the positive and negative consequences of AI integration on sustainability and valuation. The results show how successful implementation of AI-driven scalability strategies can lead to enhanced competitiveness, but also underscore potential risks and challenges.

#### Discussion
The discussion section delves into the nuances of the results, providing a nuanced interpretation of the implications for traditional firms.
